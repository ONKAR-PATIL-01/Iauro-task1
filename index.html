            Running into a world of opportunity, we question everyday ourselves to ask ‘what’s next?. Realizing the secret of the future was in platforms, iauro started to change its orientation towards Envision platform to help their customer solve business challenges. This fast paced growth and the IPs being built by IO Labs fuelled the company’s series A funding by Saraswat Infotech. At IO Labs, a new platform to fuel automated asset reuse and exponentially accelerate time to market for new platforms was ready to be launched. It was called Gessa.
